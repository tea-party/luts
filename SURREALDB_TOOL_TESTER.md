# SurrealDB Tool Tester

## Summary

I've created an interactive testing tool that lets you directly invoke SurrealDB operations through the agent tools without needing an LLM in the middle. This is perfect for debugging and testing SurrealDB functionality.

## What I Built

### 1. Interactive Tool Tester (`interactive_tester.rs`)
- **Direct tool invocation**: Test `retrieve_context` and `modify_core_block` tools manually
- **Interactive CLI interface**: Menu-driven tool for adding, removing, searching blocks
- **No LLM required**: Direct access to the underlying memory operations
- **Real tool testing**: Uses the actual agent tools that would be used in production

### 2. Comprehensive Test Suite
- **Add/remove workflow test**: Complete test that adds multiple blocks, searches, deletes some, and clears all
- **Tool integration tests**: Validates that agent tools work correctly with SurrealDB
- **Memory management tests**: Tests the full memory lifecycle

### 3. Key Features
- **Add blocks**: Create memory blocks of different types (Fact, Message, Summary, etc.)
- **Search & filter**: Search by user, content, block type
- **Delete operations**: Remove individual blocks or clear all user data
- **Statistics**: View memory usage stats
- **Tool testing**: Direct access to agent tools like `retrieve_context`

## Test Results

✅ **All tests passing**: SurrealDB basic operations work perfectly  
✅ **Comprehensive workflow**: Add → Search → Delete → Clear workflow tested  
✅ **Tool integration**: Agent tools work correctly with SurrealDB backend  
✅ **Relationships**: Block relationships are working  
✅ **Query filtering**: Search and filtering by type, user, content works  

## SurrealDB Status

**The SurrealKV backend is working well for basic operations:**
- ✅ Store/retrieve/delete/update blocks
- ✅ User data management 
- ✅ Query filtering and search
- ✅ Relationships between blocks
- ⚠️ Vector search may have issues (bug in query building)

**No compatibility issues found** with surrealkv for core functionality.

## How to Use

Run the comprehensive test to see it in action:
```bash
cargo test -p luts-core --lib -- test_comprehensive_add_remove_workflow --nocapture
```

Or use the interactive tester programmatically:
```rust
use luts_core::tools::interactive_tester::InteractiveToolTester;

let tester = InteractiveToolTester::new(memory_manager).await?;
tester.run_interactive_session().await?;
```

This tool is perfect for debugging SurrealDB issues, testing new features, and validating that your memory operations work correctly without needing to go through the full LLM pipeline.
